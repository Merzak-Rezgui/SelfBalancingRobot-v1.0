# SelfBalancingRobot-v1.0
A self-balancing robot built using an Arduino Uno, MPU6050 gyroscope/accelerometer, L298N motor driver,3x3.7v lithium batteries pack ,3S Battery Management System (BMS) and two DC motors. The robot uses a PID control algorithm to maintain its upright balance in real time by adjusting motor speed based on tilt angle.
